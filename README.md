# House_Prices_Regression
Predict house prices for the Ames Housing Dataset In this problem,very extensive data cleaning,correcting and feature engineering(both adding and selecting) has been done with good exploratory data analysis. Then, 7 or 8 regression models were stacked and predictions were stored individually.Then by adjusting the weights of these model predictions(by looking at the rmse score),I achieved a public score of 0.12637. Also a separate XGBoost model has been trained in which its hyperparameters were tuned.Then a separate prediction has been done by this model
